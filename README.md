# MedImage - Medical Image Processing Package

The "MedImage" project is driven by the ambition to bridge this gap and empower medical practitioners and researchers with a sophisticated Python package. This package is designed to serve as a comprehensive toolkit, offering an array of tools tailored explicitly for the processing and analysis of medical images. With its arsenal of innovative image filtering, edge recognition, and image segmentation capabilities, "MedImage" is poised to revolutionize medical image processing. 

The GitHub repository centralizes the source code, documentation, and collaboration on the project. The repository structure includes: 

- `image_operations.py`, `image_utils.py`, `image_filtering.py`, `image_segmentation.py`: Modules for image processing.
- 
## Goals
The "MediImage" package aims to provide intermediate-level medical image processing functionalities for Python users. It includes a variety of image processing techniques, such as filtering, edge detection, and image segmentation, commonly used in the medical field.

## Organization
The package is organized into the following modules:

1. `image_operations.py`: Contains functions for basic image processing operations on medical images, such as contrast adjustment and binary thresholding.

2. `image_utils.py`: Contains utility functions for loading and displaying medical images.

3. `image_filtering.py`: Contains functions for advanced image filtering techniques like Gaussian filtering and median filtering.

4. `image_segmentation.py`: Contains functions for image segmentation techniques like Canny edge detection and watershed segmentation.

## Installation and Usage:

Installation:

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Open a terminal and run: pip install git+https://github.com/sreesravyat/MEDIMAGE.git
Usage:

Load and display images using utility functions.
Apply Gaussian filtering, Canny edge detection, and image segmentation.
Save processed images using the provided functions.

Once the package is loaded run the main.py code by changing the image of your choice that you want to perfrom the results on and get the output in figures for all them in seperate windows.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the "MediImage" project addresses the critical shortage of advanced medical image processing technologies. MediImage represents a significance in medical image processing and analysis, contributing to improved healthcare outcomes and medical research. By automating and simplifying complex tasks, the package aims to save valuable time for healthcare practitioners, allowing them to focus on critical decision-making and providing better patient care.
