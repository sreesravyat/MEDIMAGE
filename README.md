# MediImage - Medical Image Processing Package

## Goals
The "MediImage" package aims to provide intermediate-level medical image processing functionalities for Python users. It includes a variety of image processing techniques, such as filtering, edge detection, and image segmentation, commonly used in the medical field.

## Organization
The package is organized into the following modules:

1. `image_operations.py`: Contains functions for basic image processing operations on medical images, such as contrast adjustment and binary thresholding.

2. `image_utils.py`: Contains utility functions for loading and displaying medical images.

3. `image_filtering.py`: Contains functions for advanced image filtering techniques like Gaussian filtering and median filtering.

4. `image_segmentation.py`: Contains functions for image segmentation techniques like Canny edge detection and watershed segmentation.
